Abstract: This study uses the American Community Survey 5-Year data (2015-2019), the CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability index, and Area Deprivation Index (ADI) to explore health inequity in Salt Lake County. We adopt uninsured health percent as the proxy for healthcare equity in the project and set tracts with high uninsured percent as the risk group and other tracts as the safe group. We refer to SVI variables classification and classify influencing factors under four subjects, including minority status and language, socioeconomic status, household composition, and environmental impact assessment. Using the Blinder-Oaxaca Decomposition method, empirical research finds apparent health disparities in Salt Lake County. We interpret the uninsured percentage of white alone, uninsured percentage of a native-born, uninsured percentage of worked full-time, and uninsured percent with a bachelor’s degree or higher as potentially picking up the effect of the health insurance market in Salt Lake County experience. Another factor, including the uninsured percentage of people who live in family households, impacts the gap of uninsured percentage by tracts in the risk group and the safe group. We suggest that strengthening higher education and creating new full-time job opportunities will significantly improve health insurance status in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
